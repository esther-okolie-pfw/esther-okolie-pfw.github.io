                    <h3>Extensive Analysis on Patients Experience in Public Health</h3>
                    <p>This project used data analytics techniques to provide an extensive analysis of public healthcare.
                     It focused on giving insights into the patient's experience in facilities in the US. The analysis compared the experience in 
                        different regions and some selected states in the US based on payment received, number of facilities, overall hospital rating, staff responsiveness, care transition, emergency, and vaccination.

                    <h3>Bikeshare Data Analysis with Python on Different Cities</h3>
                    <p>This project utilized Python to create an analysis application for bikeshare data 
                        from cities like New York, Chicago, and Washington. It focuses on user trends, 
                        trip durations, and popular routes. Through an interactive dashboard, users can 
                        filter by city, month, and day to visualize metrics such as the most popular start 
                        and end stations, peak riding hours, and demographic breakdowns by age and gender. 
                        This analysis provides valuable insights for city planners and bikeshare operators to 
                        optimize services and enhance user experiences.</p>

                    <h3>Exploring and Segmenting 3rivers Customers </h3>
                    <p>The aim of the project was to separate and group customers based on their habits, 
                        needs and behaviors for the purpose of product recommendation and marketing.
                        In this project, my team utilized unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means, 
                        PCA and Hierarchical clustering to segment customers based on the customer records from 3rivers.
